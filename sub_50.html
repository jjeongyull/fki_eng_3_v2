                    <div class="swiper-txt">South Korea’s exports in 2024 hit an all-time high of $683.8 billion, marking an 8.2% increase from the previous year. Semiconductors, the country’s leading export item, surged 43.9% to $141.9 billion, accounting for approximately 20% of total exports. Automobile exports exceeded $70 billion for the second consecutive year, totaling $70.8 billion, while ship exports rose 18% to $25.6 billion. By region, exports to China increased by 6.6% to $133 billion, and exports to the US jumped 10.5% to $127.8 billion—both setting new records. The overall trade surplus stood at $51.8 billion, marking South Korea’s first annual surplus in three years.</div>

In response to China’s naval buildup, the US is moving to strengthen shipbuilding alliances and has expressed willingness to collaborate with Korea in ship maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO), positioning Korea as a key partner. Hanwha Ocean, in particular, has secured a foothold by acquiring a US shipyard, and Trump’s pledge to lift LNG export restrictions has sparked speculation about a rise in LNG carrier orders.</div>

Market cap and revenue thresholds will be raised by up to tenfold, and by 2029, approximately 200 companies are expected to be delisted from the KOSPI and KOSDAQ. To accelerate the removal of suspended companies, the government will shorten delisting review procedures and improvement periods. In addition, during IPOs, the proportion of shares subject to mandatory holding commitments by institutional investors will increase from 20% to 40% to curb speculative profit-taking and early withdrawals.</div>

This growth reflects a 5.9% increase in nominal GDP and slower population growth, with improved terms of trade and rising prices acting as positive factors. However, the rising KRW-USD exchange rate offset some of the gains. If economic momentum continues, per capita GDP is expected to exceed $37,000 this year.</div>

Despite ongoing political uncertainty, Fitch positively assessed Korea’s robust external fundamentals, macroeconomic stability, and export competitiveness. However, it warned that prolonged political gridlock could undermine policy effectiveness and fiscal soundness, potentially triggering a downgrade. Fitch revised Korea’s 2025 economic growth forecast downward to 1.7%. The government pledged to strengthen communication with global rating agencies and actively manage Korea’s external creditworthiness.</div>

This marks the third rate cut since October 2023, reflecting slowing growth, weak domestic demand, and political uncertainty. The central bank revised its 2025 growth forecast down from 1.9% to 1.5%, while maintaining its 2026 outlook at 1.8%. Inflation is projected to remain steady at 1.9% for both 2025 and 2026.</div>

The total fertility rate also edged up to 0.75. The rise was attributed to more marriages and an increase in the female population in their 30s. This result aligns with the most optimistic mid- to long-term demographic projections. However, deaths still outnumbered births, leading to a natural population decline of 120,000. Korea’s fertility rate remains the lowest among OECD countries, still far below the replacement level of 1.0.</div>

Large and mid-sized firms will receive up to 20% in credits, while small businesses can claim up to 30%. The move is seen as crucial to enhancing Korea’s semiconductor competitiveness and keeping pace with incentives offered by the US, Taiwan, and other rivals. Industry leaders welcomed the bill, expecting it to accelerate technological and production advancements and spur a virtuous investment cycle. Business groups praised the legislation for easing pressures on the industry amid external uncertainties and boosting momentum in the Korean economy.</div>

Key initiatives include the development of a 1,000-qubit quantum computer, deployment of quantum communication networks and navigation sensors, and the localization of related materials, components, and equipment.

China is actively seeking to advance the FTA as part of its strategy to counterbalance US-China tensions and bolster regional influence. Korea and Japan, while recognizing the importance of economic ties with China, remain cautious due to the geopolitical sensitivity surrounding US-China strategic rivalry.

The US justifies its differentiated tariff rates by citing each country’s tariff and non-tariff barriers, raising concerns that key Korean exports such as automobiles and semiconductors will be severely impacted.

                    <div class="swiper-txt">On April 9, the KRW-USD exchange rate surged to KRW 1,487, its highest level since the 2009 global financial crisis. Analysts attribute the spike to growing concerns over a renewed US-China trade war, which have weakened the Chinese yuan. With the US preparing to impose tariffs of up to 104% on Chinese imports, the offshore yuan fell sharply, dragging the Korean won lower. If China continues to devalue the yuan, the won may face further upward pressure.

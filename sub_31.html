          Bringing in South Korea’s first quantum computer must have been both a significant opportunity and a considerable risk. What led Yonsei University’s Quantum Division to adopt the IBM Quantum System One?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          A university’s role is to cultivate creative talent on a background of flexible thinking. Yonsei University is confident that quantum computing is necessary to lead future academic fields and to support humanity’s sustainable future. It is our clear vision that adopting a quantum computer would establish Yonsei University as a hub within the knowledge ecosystem. That’s why we decided to take the risk and adopt a quantum computer.<br>
          Quantum computing can provide revolutionary solutions that are fundamentally different from classical computing. It will have a major impact on core industries such as defense, IT, and finance. Ultimately, the advancement of quantum computing technology is directly tied to national competitiveness. As technology becomes more advanced, it is highly likely that technological exchanges between countries will be restricted. Some leading countries are already showing signs of regulating personnel and technology exchanges related to quantum technologies.<br>
          Considering this context, Yonsei University’s adoption of the IBM Quantum System One holds significance in three key aspects. First, it will broaden the understanding of quantum computing and accelerate its practical application by enabling real hardware testing and expanding potential use cases. Second, by allowing researchers and students to directly engage with quantum computers, it will provide opportunities to train skilled professionals with hands-on experience. Third, it will facilitate building a network with leading global companies and research institutions, expanding opportunities for international collaboration, including joint research. Thus, Yonsei University’s introduction of a quantum computer is more than just acquiring research equipment—it is expected to drive the advancement of quantum computing technology and play a vital role in the global research ecosystem.

      <div class="sub-page-text-div mb-50">
        <p class="sub-p-title mb-text">
          Unlike the field of quantum computer manufacturing, most countries are starting from scratch in the field of quantum computing software, and standards for quantum-related technologies have yet to be established. In which areas should South Korea focus its efforts, and how should it prepare for the future in the quantum computing field?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          The industrial value of quantum computing is likely to come more from its practical applications than from the technology itself. Even if hardware performance improves, it will be difficult to create industrial value without the algorithms and application technologies needed to effectively use that hardware. Therefore, to make up for its weaker position in hardware, South Korea should actively invest in software and algorithm development.<br>
          Enhancing the practical usability of quantum software through research and developing diverse application cases will be key tasks. Drug discovery and healthcare are particularly promising fields with high market potential and major challenges facing humanity. South Korea’s selection of AI & semiconductors, advanced biotechnology, and quantum technology as its “three game changers” reflects this strategic alignment. In my personal view, quantum computing algorithms will become a key element linking these technologies together.

          Yonsei’s quantum computer has been installed at the Songdo Bio National Advanced Strategic Industry Specialized Complex, and I understand that you plan to prioritize collaboration with companies in the bio sector. Many companies are reportedly interested because quantum computing is expected to reduce the time and cost involved in drug development. What are your plans for research collaboration with bio companies?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          In the value chain of drug development, the most pressing challenge for companies is reducing the time and cost involved in the R&D cycle, which includes designing, synthesizing, and verifying new drug candidates. Since synthesis and verification are relatively standardized fields, drug design will be the key area of collaboration with bio companies. Currently, various methods are being used in drug design, from traditional approaches such as CADD<span class="sub-tool">1</span>to more advanced AI-based drug design. This is the most critical bottleneck that most biopharmaceutical companies are focused on improving. Recently, the US-based AI drug discovery start-up Insilico Medicine reported that it achieved approximately 21% better results in AI-based drug design using an IBM 16-qubit quantum processor. This demonstrates that even today’s NISQ<span class="sub-tool">2</span>level quantum computers have the potential to be practically applied in the drug development industry.<br>
          We are currently working with antibody-based CDMO<span class="sub-tool">3</span> companies and drug development firms to enhance antibody engineering capabilities. Additionally, we plan to continue research collaboration to support the establishment of a global pharmaceutical company within the Bio National Advanced Strategic Industry Specialized Complex, capable of developing de novo<span class="sub-tool">4</span> (new target) drugs within the next 10 years.

          We’re curious about IBM’s vision for the future of quantum computing. What is your outlook on the quantum computing sector in the Korean market?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          IBM believes that quantum computing will become a groundbreaking technology capable of solving problems that today’s most powerful supercomputers struggle or fail to address. To drive this vision forward, IBM has established a vast quantum ecosystem called the “Quantum Network.”<br>
          Currently, over 275 organizations worldwide, including Fortune 500 companies, research institutions, universities, and startups, are collaborating within this network. Leading participants include Cleveland Clinic, Moderna, Bosch, ExxonMobil, CERN, DESY, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, University of Chicago, and University of Luxembourg. These working groups are focused on rapidly unlocking the potential of quantum technology in fields such as medical and life sciences, high-energy physics, new material development, optimization, and sustainability in the energy sector.<br>
          In South Korea, major corporations such as Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Hyundai Motor Company, and POSCO—as well as telecom companies like SK Telecom, KT, and LG U+—have already announced their interest and involvement in quantum technology research. Most importantly, the Korean government has officially designated quantum technology as a “game changer” that may impact technological dominance committing to long-term investment and full-scale support.<br>
          In November last year, IBM installed and activated the 127-qubit “IBM Quantum System One” at the Yonsei University International Campus in Songdo. The IBM Quantum System One is a quantum computer at the “utility scale”—a point at which quantum computers could serve as scientific tools to explore a new scale of problems that classical systems may never be able to solve. This development is expected to accelerate quantum research and talent development in Korea, fostering faster dissemination of related technologies among Korean companies.

        <p class="sub-p-title mb-text">
          How can quantum computing enhance the competitiveness of Korean companies?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          As mentioned earlier, quantum computing provides various solutions based on its massive computational power, so its applications are not limited to specific industries. Considering the structure of Korea’s industrial landscape, quantum computing is expected to play an increasingly innovative role in the following areas.<br>
          First, the semiconductor and materials industries can benefit from quantum computing. The technology is capable of precisely analyzing molecular structures of materials, which can enable new semiconductor material development and manufacturing process optimization in the semiconductors and materials industries. For example, the development of next-generation batteries for electric vehicles, which requires research into new materials to improve performance and lifespan, could be accelerated with faster and more accurate chemical simulations enabled by quantum computing. Second, quantum computing is likely to become a key driver of transformation in the financial industry, as quantum algorithms can enable more sophisticated approaches to portfolio optimization, risk management, and fraud detection. Lastly, significant changes are expected in the medical and drug development fields. Quantum computing can be used to analyze the molecular structure of drug candidates and predict protein interactions, leading to reduced research costs and shorter drug development timelines.<br>
          Quantum computing holds the potential to drive innovation across all industries. Korean companies’ active pursuit of quantum computing research and adoption may facilitate securing global technological leadership while also creating new business opportunities.

        Challenges for Korean Companies and Government Support Strategies
      </div>
      <div class="sub-page-text-div mb-50">
        <p class="sub-p-title mb-text">
          What are the key challenges Korean companies may face when adopting quantum computing technology, and how can they overcome them?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Two major obstacles are likely to pose significant challenges. The first is human resources. The Korean government and the education sector have been making various efforts to develop talent in quantum technology, such as the “Quantum Leadership Program” that the Ministry of Science and ICT has been running with IBM and Sungkyunkwan University for several years. However, developing talent takes time, so even if companies want to pursue quantum research, there is still a shortage of qualified personnel who can properly conduct quantum computing research. The second challenge is the difficulty of generating short-term return on investment. Although quantum computing is advancing rapidly, it is still in its early stages of commercialization and requires medium- to long-term strategies and investment. Short-term business results may not be readily forthcoming, and as a result, companies are hesitant to invest heavily into quantum research. This in turn, makes it difficult for the carefully cultivated quantum talent to find stable employment opportunities. Government-level investment and support are essential to address these challenges. Fortunately, the Korean government recently designated quantum technology development as a national agenda and announced related investments and support—an encouraging development. For example, the Ministry of Science and ICT and the National Research Foundation of Korea are supporting the “Quantum Advantage Challenge” to lower the initial barriers for companies and identify successful business cases using quantum technology, thereby encouraging broader adoption of quantum computing.<br>
          Korean companies also need to take a long-term, strategic approach to quantum computing. Collaborating with universities and research institutions to train specialists is essential. Companies must also create opportunities for these specialists to develop practical quantum applications. Additionally, building technical expertise through ongoing exchanges with foreign experts will be crucial. Increased industry-academic-research collaboration will help strengthen Korea’s quantum research programs and support startups.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sub-page-text-div mb-50">
        <p class="sub-p-title mb-text">
          Why should Korean companies invest in quantum computing now, even though the technology is still in its early stages?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Quantum computing is expected to reshape the computing paradigm over the next 5 to 10 years. Leading companies in the United States, Europe, China, and Japan are already conducting large-scale research and development under government leadership. Since quantum computing requires long-term strategy and research, delaying entry into the field will make it difficult for Korean companies to remain competitive. Korea has strengths in semiconductors, IT, and batteries, which would benefit from integration of existing expertise and know-how with quantum research. This could propel Korean companies forward in driving new innnovation and establishing global market-leader status.<br>
          This holds true even after quantum computing becomes commercialized. Widespread adoption of quantum computing will require changes to encryption systems and data security infrastructure. Early investment and research will allow Korean companies to adapt to these shifts and stay competitive.

          Lastly, how do you see the potential for collaboration between IBM and Korean companies? Are there any ongoing projects or future plans you can share?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          IBM is already working with Korean companies, the government, and academia to advance quantum computing technology, train talent, and expand the ecosystem. Leading Korean companies such as Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, and Doosan, as well as startups and top universities like Sungkyunkwan University, Yonsei University, Seoul National University, and KAIST have joined the IBM Quantum Network to conduct research related to quantum computing.<br>
          To cultivate advanced quantum talent, IBM has been running a Quantum Leadership Expert Training Program at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center headquarters. Each year, the Ministry of Science and ICT, companies, and researchers (including doctoral and postdoctoral candidates) participate in this program. IBM is also collaborating with the Ministry of SMEs and Startups to support promising startups through education and funding initiatives.<br>
          Additionally, a project is underway among Korean, American, and Japanese universities (respectively, Yonsei University, Seoul National University; University of Chicago; and the University of Tokyo and Keio University) to advance the training of up to 40,000 students by 2033. Finally, with the launch of the Yonsei Quantum Computing Center and the operation of the IBM Quantum System One since last November, IBM expects to expand collaboration with more domestic companies and research institutions. Through consistent partnerships with various organizations, IBM expects to play a key role in developing Korea’s quantum ecosystem.

            The Beginning of Innovation: Project IONIQ
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            IONIQ is Hyundai Motor’s first dedicated electric vehicle brand, created with a vision to completely redefine and realize the future of mobility. The name “IONIQ” combines “ion,” which carries an electric charge, and “unique,” symbolizing originality and the ambition for a new form of mobility.<br>
            IONIQ began with Project IONIQ, a lab founded in 2016 to anticipate changes in future mobility and lifestyle while realizing the freedom of movement. The project first made its mark with a model lineup consisting of three powertrains: hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles. Passion among those working toward overcoming the limitations of traditional mobility and building a sustainable society grew even stronger, and this collective ambition led to the rebirth of IONIQ as Hyundai’s dedicated electric vehicle brand in 2020. At the time, IONIQ announced its launch as a brand and declared its vision for a sustainable future through the “I’m in Charge”<span class="sub-tool">1</span> campaign.<br>
            IONIQ serves as a foundation for Hyundai Motor’s vision of “Progress for Humanity” while playing a pivotal role in driving the company’s overall innovation and progress, generating a halo effect across the Hyundai brand.

            Setting a New Standard for Electric Vehicles
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            ONIQ has reached global consumers with a higher level of product competitiveness in terms of design, performance, and spaciousness. The lineup so far includes the IONIQ 5, introduced in 2021; the Electrified Streamliner IONIQ 6, launched in 2022; the Hyundai N’s first high-performance EV, the IONIQ 5 N, unveiled in 2023; and the three-row SUV IONIQ 9, released in 2024.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            As a result of relentless innovation and progress, the IONIQ 5 achieved a remarkable milestone of surpassing 100,000 cumulative sales in the US as of December 2024—just three years and one month after it was first launched in the US market. Since 2022, the IONIQ lineup has been honored at the World Car Awards three times in a row, which is the most prestigious of international automobile accolades. In 2022, the IONIQ 5 won three major titles: World Car of the Year (WCOTY), World Electric Vehicle, and World Car Design of the Year. In 2023, the IONIQ 6 replicated this achievement by winning all three awards, marking back-to-back triple crown victories. In 2024, the IONIQ 5 N was awarded the honor of World Performance Car, once again proving the excellence of the IONIQ lineup. IONIQ’s successful expansion in the electric vehicle market can be attributed to three key factors. The first is its design concept. All IONIQ models feature the distinctive “Parametric Pixel”–a unique jewel-like design. This unique design element has become a symbol of the IONIQ brand. The second factor is performance. Built on Hyundai Motor Group’s cutting-edge Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), IONIQ vehicles offer ultra-fast 800V charging and V2L technology, which allows the vehicle to supply power to external devices. For example, the new IONIQ 5 can charge from 10% to 80% in under 18 minutes with a 350 kW fast charger<span class="sub-tool">2</span> and has a driving range of up to 570km<span class="sub-tool">3</span> on a single charge. The third factor is flexible space. IONIQ maximizes interior space to enable greater freedom for passengers, transforming the vehicle into a versatile living space that adapts to different lifestyles and activities.

            The New Face of the IONIQ Lineup
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            The latest addition to the IONIQ brand is the three-row, all-electric SUV, the IONIQ 9. Hyundai Motor made a bold move by introducing the flagship IONIQ 9, demonstrating confidence in its electrification strategy. The IONIQ 9 stands out with its sophisticated design. Its sleek silhouette features diagonal lines inspired by the clean lines of a hanbok jeogori (Korean traditional jacket), and its turbine-inspired wheel design evokes the look of an aircraft engine. Built on the E-GMP, the IONIQ 9 offers maximum interior space across the second and third rows, accommodating up to seven passengers. The model also features various seat configurations, including relaxation and swiveling seats, and comes equipped with a Universal Island 2.0 console designed for flexible use and bidirectional opening.<br>
            The IONIQ 9’s expansive interior sets a new benchmark for shared mobility, offering a space that can adapt to different lifestyles. This reflects the core philosophy behind the IONIQ 9: “Built to belong”—creating a sense of connection and meeting the needs of both individual passengers and shared experiences. After launching in the Korean market in February, the IONIQ 9 will expand to the US and European markets in later this year.<br>
            Under Hyundai’s global vision of “Progress for Humanity,” IONIQ continues to provide customers with innovative electrification experiences and enhanced everyday mobility tailored to diverse lifestyles. If you value spaciousness, flexibility, and sleek style, the future of mobility with IONIQ is worth keeping an eye on.

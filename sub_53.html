              A New Engine for Regional Economies
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              “Loconomy”—a portmanteau of “local” and “economy”—refers to consumption and production activities centered on local communities. As concerns about global supply chain instability grow, supporting local economies has emerged as a socially valuable alternative.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              An increasing number of consumers prefer direct trade with regional producers over large-scale retailers, fueling the growth of local platforms and community-based markets. In Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province, a new brand offering processed foods made from local agricultural products is helping to increase farmers’ incomes. Meanwhile, in Yeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, local traditional liquor breweries are being integrated into tourism programs, attracting visitors and revitalizing the local economy.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              According to a U&A study by Embrain Trend Monitor, 8 out of 10 respondents (81.6%) reported having purchased loconomy food products, while 60.5% viewed such purchases as a form of meaningful consumption.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              By delivering unique experiences to consumers while simultaneously strengthening local economies, the loconomy trend is expected to continue expanding in scale and influence.

              Healing Through Experience
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              Travel in Korea is no longer just about sightseeing—it’s increasingly becoming a form of mental and physical healing. This shift toward wellness tourism has accelerated in the wake of the pandemic, reflecting a broader emphasis on holistic health and inner peace. According to the Global Wellness Institute, the global wellness tourism market reached approximately $830.2 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at an annual rate of 10.2% through 2028.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              In Korea, travel offerings centered around nature-based healing have been on the rise. Jeju Island, for instance, has become a popular destination for “healing forest retreat programs” that combine forest meditation with botanical therapy to help participants find mental balance and improve their overall health. In Gangwon Province, a resort offering a “wellness spa program” that blends natural hot springs with traditional Korean medicine has seen strong demand.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              These wellness-driven experiences are also giving a boost to regional economies, and custom wellness programs that collaborate with local brands and communities are becoming more popular.

              A Sustainable Reinvention
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              More and more, modern individuals are breaking free from rigid social norms and obligations, choosing instead to pursue personal happiness on their own terms. “Re-born” captures this shift—a movement of rediscovering oneself and reimagining a new life beyond past burdens.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              Office workers are leaving established careers to explore new paths, whether as freelancers or digital nomads, seeking lifestyles that align with their personal values. Some choose to leave city life altogether, embracing self-sufficiency in nature and building new kinds of communities. Others are finding renewed purpose through creative expression or social contribution, redefining what fulfillment looks like.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              The “Re-born” trend is reshaping not only individual lives but broader social structures. Companies are beginning to offer more opportunities for career transitions and are embracing flexible work environments to support this shift. More than a passing fad, “Re-born” represents a meaningful evolution in how people today approach life.

            Humanity in the Age of AI
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            “Homo Prompt” is a neologism born in the era of artificial intelligence. It refers to a new kind of human—one who not only uses AI effectively but adapts to coexist and collaborate with it.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            As AI becomes a powerful productivity tool across industries, the ability to skillfully interact with it is emerging as a key competitive asset. In education, too, emphasis is growing on developing AI literacy and exploring effective models of human–AI collaboration.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            Designers and artists are creating new forms of work with the help of AI, while programmers are leveraging AI-assisted coding environments to improve efficiency. At the same time, businesses are using AI-powered data analysis to shape smarter strategies.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            In the future, humans will evolve beyond using AI as a mere tool; they will become partners in co-creating new value. In the age of “Homo Prompt,” the ability to ask creative questions and harness AI’s potential will define true innovation.
